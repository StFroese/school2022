<!-- Dear instructor:
* The dates at the top of this markdown (.md) document will help order the classes in the portal.
Please, if you don't need to, do not change the one that is now.
* Take into account that there is a feature in the dates: if you use a date in the future, the class will be not visible in the portal until the date you have assigned.
* You can create dedicated folders if you need to.
* But if you simply need to add some pictures, you can use the folder ../static/img/ mentioned at the top as /school2021/img/

## Summary

Making research results more accessible and reproducible can contribute to better and more efficient science, however widespread adoption of open research practices has not yet been achieved. Funding agencies (such as the European Commission Horizon 2020) are increasingly requiring research products (such as data, code and publications) to be made openly available in order to make results more accessible, transparent and reproducible. Recent studies have also shown that open research practices are associated with benefits to the researcher such as increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job and funding opportunities. In this talk I will discuss the different aspects of Open Science, the barriers we face to practicing openly, how to "open" up your research workflow using open and transparent data and software services in order to reap the benefits associated with open research practices.
