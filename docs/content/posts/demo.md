DEMO CLASS - TO BE REMOVED

<!--more-->
<!---->

<!-- Dear instructor:
* The dates at the top of this markdown (.md) document will help order the classes in the portal.
Please, if you don't need to, do not change the one that is now.
* Take into account that there is a feature in the dates: if you use a date in the future, the class will be not visible in the portal until the date you have assigned.
* You can create dedicated folders if you need to.
* But if you simply need to add some pictures, you can use the folder ../static/img/ mentioned at the top as /school2021/img/

## Summary

It refers to a series of principles, techniques, tools and practical considerations that allow the documentation, recording and preservation of data analysis pipelines â€” enhancing the possibilities of collaborations across borders and increasing the probabilities of replicating results by others (and yourself) in the future. Reproducibility involves using standard and well-established protocols to ensure that your code will survive outside your computer, the passing of time and that others will be able to use it as a starting point for new analysis. We will explore several of those tools: from the use of version control and [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) in the cloud to prepare and encapsulate software environments (VM, containers) and the usage of good practices regarding licences, citation and DOIs.

## The Code
Several notebooks with analysis examples and an interface to launch the framework mentioned above, are available using executable platforms.
