## Summary

The first step to writing code is to first get it to work both syntactically and scientifically, and later to make it work fast. This lecture will cover both aspects: first the use of a /debugger/ to identify and fix broken code, and then the use of profiling tools to identify which parts of working code be improved for speed or memory usage.
